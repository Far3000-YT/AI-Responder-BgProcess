# Responder using AI APIs (works on anything, quizzes, normal questions... etc)
# AI used : Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental (smartest model as of now)

project should not work for now unless u fix it manually

will redo the README.md completely #inwork

objectives (briefly):
* make this a more serious project (has potential imo) (structuring the whole thing and not make it a single file..)
* make it really working in the background, and not some random terminal program u launch like this
* make it 100% undetectable and customizable in term of signals (when the api request finished, find a way to prevent basically)
* allow the user to change options freely (model, temperature, prompts... etc)
* more soon ?
